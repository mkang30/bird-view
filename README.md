# Bird View

Bird View is a 3D OpenGL graphics project built from scratch. The app is composed of two different scenes - the view of a natural terrain from the bird's height and the simulation of reflection physics. Various graphical techniques such as Depth of Field and Procedural Terrain Generation were used to bring more realistic rendering.

## Technichal Features
- **Real-time grpahics tenchnique 3D render**
- **Implementation of customizable Depth of Field**
- **Procefural Terrain Generation with the Perlin noise map**
- **Environment mapping for reflection imitation**
